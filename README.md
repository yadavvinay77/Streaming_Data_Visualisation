Word Processing with PySpark and Matplotlib
This Python script demonstrates word processing using PySpark and Matplotlib. The script processes a collection of text documents, each represented as a line, by removing short words and creating word count statistics. After processing each line, a bar chart is plotted to visualize the word count distribution.

# Prerequisites
Python
PySpark
Matplotlib

# Installation


1. Install PySpark:
    pip install pyspark

2. Install Matplotlib:
    pip install matplotlib

# Usage

1. Clone the repository:

  git clone https://github.com/your-username/word-processing-pyspark.git
  cd word-processing-pyspark

2. Run the script:

  python word_processing.py


3. View the processed lines and word count statistics for each line in the console output.

# Customization

You can customize the input text documents by modifying the documents variable at the beginning of the script. Adjust the number of top words (N) to display in the output.

# Notes

The script uses PySpark for parallelized data processing and Matplotlib for visualizing word count statistics.
